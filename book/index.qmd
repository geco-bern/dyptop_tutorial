This tutorial explains and demonstrates a scalable wetland and peatland modelling approach, implemented by the Dynamical Peatland Model Based on TOPMODEL (DYPTOP) [@stocker14dyptop]. The demonstration contrasts two regions, the extent around the central Congo Basin peatland complex (@fig-maps_domain_congo) [@dargie17nat], and Switzerland (@fig-maps_domain_switzerland) in @sec-fflooded. @sec-wetlands then demonstrates the application of the DYPTOP modelling approach at the global scale.
