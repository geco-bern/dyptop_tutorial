This tutorial explains and demonstrates a scalable wetland and peatland modelling approach, implemented by the Dynamical Peatland Model Based on TOPMODEL (DYPTOP) [@stocker14dyptop]. The demonstration contrasts two regions, the extent around the central Congo Basin peatland complex [@dargie17nat], and Switzerland.
